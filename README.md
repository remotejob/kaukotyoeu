* static contents as well as templates (assets,templates dirs)  incorporated in docker container
by command COPY in Dockerfile
* COPY assets/ /assets/
* COPY templates /templates/
* We are need only one line in code to serve all assets contents r.PathPrefix("/assets/").Handler(http.StripPrefix("/assets/", fs))
